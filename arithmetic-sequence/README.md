# Arithmetic Sequence

## Task Description

Implement method [Calculate](ArithmeticSequence/ArithmeticSequence.cs#L21) that calculates the sum of the first `n` elements of a sequence in which each element is the sum of the given integer `a`, and a number of occurrences of the given integer `r`, based on the element's position within the sequence. *The task definition is given in the XML-comments for the method.*

```
1     2        3          4            5
a + (a+r) + (a+r+r) + (a+r+r+r) + (a+r+r+r+r) 
2 + (2+3) + (2+3+3) + (2+3+3+3) + (2+3+3+3+3) = 40
```

*Topics - basic operation.*
