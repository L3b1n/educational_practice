# While Statements

Beginner level task for practicing while statements.

Estimated time to complete the task - 3h.

The task requires .NET 6 SDK installed.


## Task Description

The task has fifteen sub-tasks in five sections. Each sub-task is a small coding exercise.

Basic understanding of [flowchart diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) (или см. русскоязычную [статью Блок-схема](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BA-%D1%81%D1%85%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B0)) is required to successfully complete the task. If you are not familiar with flowchart diagrams, read the Wikipedia article first.

Use the only *while* and *if-else* statements in this task. Using *for* or *do-while* iteration statements is not required.


### Arithmetic Sequences

An [arithmetic sequence](https://www.google.com/search?q=arithmetic+sequence) is an ordered set of terms (numbers) that have a common difference between each consecutive term.

The arithmetic sequence formula is given as,

$`a_{n} = a+(n-1)*d`$

where,
* $`a_{n}`$ is the nth term,
* $`a`$ is the first term, and
* d is the [common difference](https://www.google.com/search?q=arithmetic+sequence+common+difference).


#### Sub-task 1

Open the [ArithmeticSequences.cs](WhileStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs) file, and navigate to the [SumArithmeticSequenceTerms1](WhileStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs#L5) method.

Implement the method that returns sum of an arithmetic sequence terms if the common difference is 1.

$`\sum_{i=1}^{n} a+(i-1)*1=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a+i`$

For the arithmetic sequence $`{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...}`$ the sum of the first five elements is 35 (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9).

The algorithm you have to implement is shown on the flowchart diagram below. The flowchart notation has no special symbol for a _while_ statement, therefore a decision block is used it.

Read and analyze the diagram, add the code to the _SumArithmeticSequenceTerms1_ method. 

1. Declare and initialize the _sum_ and the _i_ variables. Add the [return statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/jump-statements#the-return-statement) to return the _sum_ value.

```cs
public static int SumArithmeticSequenceTerms1(int a, int n)
{
    int sum = 0, i = 0;

    return sum;
}
```

2. Add the [while statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/statements/iteration-statements#the-while-statement) that iterates until _i_ is less than _n_.

```cs
public static int SumArithmeticSequenceTerms1(int a, int n)
{
    int sum = 0, i = 0;

    while (i < n)
    {
        i = i + 1;
    }

    return sum;
}
```

3. Add the sum calculation.

```cs
public static int SumArithmeticSequenceTerms1(int a, int n)
{
    int sum = 0, i = 0;

    while (i < n)
    {
        sum = sum + a + i
        i = i + 1;
    }

    return sum;
}
```

4. Replace the assignment with [addition assignment operator +=](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/addition-operator).

```cs
public static int SumArithmeticSequenceTerms1(int a, int n)
{
    int sum = 0, i = 0;

    while (i < n)
    {
        sum += a + i;
        i = i + 1;
    }

    return sum;
}
```

5. Replace the assignment with [increment operator++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/arithmetic-operators#increment-operator-).

```cs
public static int SumArithmeticSequenceTerms1(int a1, int n)
{
    int sum = 0, i = 0;

    while (i < n)
    {
        sum += a + i;
        i++;
    }

    return sum;
}
```


#### Sub-task 2

Open the [ArithmeticSequences.cs](WhileStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs) file, and navigate to the [SumArithmeticSequenceTerms2](WhileStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs#L5) method.

Implement the method that returns the sum of an arithmetic sequence elements when the first term is 17 and the common difference is 33.

$`\sum_{i=1}^{n} 17+(i-1)*33=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 17+i*33`$

Beginner programmers often put number literals in their code like this:

```cs
public static int SumArithmeticSequenceTerms2(int n)
{
    int sum = 0, i = 0;

    while (i < n)
    {
        sum += 17 + (i * 33);
        i++;
    }

    return sum;
}
```

Experienced programmers consider using number literals with unexplained meaning as a *bad practice*. They call such literals [magic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)).

If you have a magic number in your code, [replace it with a symbolic constant](https://refactoring.guru/replace-magic-number-with-symbolic-constant):

```cs
public static int SumArithmeticSequenceTerms2(int n)
{
    const int firstTerm = 17;
    const int commonDifference = 33;

    int sum = 0, i = 0;

    while (i < n)
    {
        sum += firstTerm + (i * commonDifference);
        i++;
    }

    return sum;
}
```


#### Sub-task 3

Open the [ArithmeticSequences.cs](WhileStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs) file, and navigate to the [SumArithmeticSequenceTerms3](WhileStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs#L5) method.

Implement the method that returns the sum of an arithmetic sequence elements when the common difference is 3.

$`\sum_{i=1}^{n} a+(i-1)*3=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a+i*3`$

Introduce a constant to avoid magic numbers in your code.


#### Sub-task 4

Open the [ArithmeticSequences.cs](WhileStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs) file, and navigate to the [SumArithmeticSequenceTerms4](WhileStatements/ArithmeticSequences.cs#L5) method.

Implement the method that returns the sum of an arithmetic sequence elements.


### Quadratic Sequences

A [quadratic sequence](https://www.google.com/search?q=quadratic+sequence) is an ordered set of terms that follows a rule based on the sequence $`n^2=1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...`$.

The quadratic sequence formula is:

$`a_{n} = a*n^2+b*n+c`$

where,
* $`a_{n}`$ is the nth term, and
* $`a`$, $`b`$ and $`c`$ are constants.


#### Sub-task 5

Open the [QuadraticSequences.cs](WhileStatements/QuadraticSequences.cs) file, and navigate to the [SumQuadraticSequenceTerms1](WhileStatements/QuadraticSequences.cs#L5) method.

Implement the method that returns sum of a quadratic sequence terms that are less than _maxTerm_.

The quadratic sequence with nth term $`a_{n}=3*n^2+5*n+7`$ is $`\{ 15, 29, 49, 75, 107, 145, ...\}`$.

If _maxTerm_ is 29, the sum is 44 (15 + 29 = 44). If _maxTerm_ is 107, the sum is 275 (15 + 29 + 49 + 75 + 107 = 275).

The algorithm you have to implement is shown on the flowchart diagram below.

#### Sub-task 6

Open the [QuadraticSequences.cs](WhileStatements/QuadraticSequences.cs) file, and navigate to the [SumQuadraticSequenceTerms2](WhileStatements/QuadraticSequences.cs#L5) method.

Implement the method that returns the sum of _count_ quadratic sequence terms starting with the _startN_ term.

For the quadratic sequence $`\{ 15, 29, 49, 75, ...\}`$ the sum is 44 (15 + 29 = 44), if the _startN_ is 1 and _count_ is 2. If _startN_ is 2 and _count_ is 3, the sum is 153 (29 + 49 + 75 = 153).


### Geometric Sequences

A [geometric sequence](https://www.google.com/search?q=geometric+sequence) is a sequence of terms in which the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.

The geometric sequence formula is given as,

$`a_{n} = a*r^n`$

where,
* $`a_{n}`$ is the nth term,
* $`a`$ is the first term, and
* r is the [common ratio](https://www.google.com/search?q=geometric+sequence+common+ratio).

Use an additional _while_ statement to raise an _r_ number to the power of _n_.

The algorithm you have to implement is shown on the flowchart diagram below.
